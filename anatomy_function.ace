Remark	"Five obviously mosaic animals are described in categories 1 and 2 of Table 2. The category 1 mosaics are semi-Dpy and Unc. These animals were found to have cell death survivors only among cells generated from the ABp lineage. The category 2 mosaic, with an apparent ABa loss, was semiDpy and non-Unc (although this animal moved more slowly than does a wild-type animal). These results again indicate that ced-3 is cell autonomous and reveal that unc-26, like unc-30, acts in the ABp lineage. "

Remark	"We screened dpy-17 let-756 ncl-1 unc-36; sDp3 animals for mosaic animals. Dpy non-Unc animals were extremely rare, and the few Dpy non-Unc animals identified turned out to result from the breakdown of the free duplication. This striking finding suggests that the cellular focus of let-756 is not easily separable from that of dpy-17. DPY-17 is thought to be required in the P1 lineage."

Remark	"We further examined the 36 animals of Class IV, in which ABaraappaaa was transformed into an e3D-like cell that had lost the array. We determined the cell division at which the array had been mitotically lost by scoring the presence or absence of the array in cells that shared a precursor cell with ABaraappaaa at some point of their lineage history. We identified 10 animals that had an extra e3D-like cell and had lost the array at the cell division of ABaraapp (Fig. 3E). This observation indicates that the presence of a functional ngn-1 gene in ABaraapp is insufficient to generate an MI neuron and thus that to generate MI a functional ngn-1 gene is necessary at or later than the stage of ABaraappa, the MI grandmother cell. By contrast, we identified no animals that had lost the array at the next cell division, that of the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappa (Fig. 3E). This result suggests that in all animals in which the array was present in the MI grandmother cell, ABaraappaaa differentiated as normal into an MI neuron whether the array was (Class I animals) or was not (Class II animals) transmitted to the presumptive MI neuron. Thus, the presence of the array in the MI grandmother cell was sufficient to rescue the MI transformation of ngn-1(n1921) mutants. Together, these findings indicate that the presence of the ngn-1 wild-type gene in the MI grandmother cell is both necessary and sufficient to generate an MI neuron and establish left-right asymmetry in the cell lineage."

We first identified animals that specifically lost this transgene in the EMS blastomere, which is the precursor of the somatic gonad and gut but not the germline, and 95% of these animals exhibited abnormal and distal oocytes. Thus, egrh-1 function is required in somatic tissues derived from EMS. We next identified mosaic animals that lost the transgene only in MS or E, the descendants of EMS that give rise to the somatic gonad or gut, respectively. Loss in either MS or E resulted in the egrh-1 phenotype, strongly suggesting that egrh-1 function is required in both the somatic gonad and the gut for normal oocyte development."

Remark	"Killing the ASK neurons reduced the leaving rate of Hawaiin animals, indicating that ASK can promote leaving. The ablation resembled the effect of the ASK::tyra-3 transgene, suggesting that tyra-3 reduces ASK activity. In agreement with this idea, killing the ASK neurons in a strain with the N2 high-activity tyra-3 allele did not reduce their leaving rates further."

Remark	"To further examine the role of the vulval cells in promoting basement membrane gap expansion, we reduced the number of VPCs by laser ablating all VPCs except the innermost P6.p descendants P6.pa and P6.pp, a treatment that does not interfere with anchor cell invasion and results in the isolated development of primary-fated vulF cells. This reduction of the number and invagination of VPCs decreased the expansion of the basement membrane gap."

Remark	"To examine further the role of DAF-18 in AIY, we generated transgenic animals that expressed a daf-18 cDNA from the AIY-specific promoter ttx-3g. When we examined daf-18(mg198) animals expressing this construct, we observed that they were rescued for the neurite length defect in AIY. These results indicate that expression of DAF-18 specifically in AIY is sufficient to rescue the neurite length defects seen in daf18(mg198) mutants."

Remark	"Published_as his-9"
Remark	"We generated animals carrying an extrachromosomal array containing the his-9(H113D) transgene marked with cell-autonomous gfp reporters sur-5::gfp and unc-119::gfp. We observed that none of the 45 animals in which the array loss had occurred at or prior to the division of ABaraapp showed MI transformation. By contrast, of 686 animals in which the his-9(H113D) array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell, 293 animals (43%) displayed MI transformation, suggesting that his-9 gain-of-function activity acts cell-autonomously to cause MI transformation. In addition, we identified 38 animals in which the array had been lost at the cell division of either ABaraappa or ABaraappaa. Three of these thirty-eight animals (3%) showed MI transformation. This low fraction of MI transformation compared to that of the animals in which the array was present in the postmitotic ABaraappaaa cell (43%) likely reflects two groups among the 38 animals, one in which the array had been lost at the ABaraappa division and another in which the array loss had occurred at the ABaraappaa division. Together these observations suggest that the presence of the his-9(H113D) transgene in ABaraappaa, the MI mother cell, is sufficient to cause MI transformation. We concluded that his-9 gain-of-function activity cell-autonomously acts in the MI mother cell to cause MI transformation."

We observed that mosaic animals retaining the array in AIY were rescued for the AIY presynaptic defect, whereas animals that did not retain the array in AIY, but retained it in other cells, such as postsynaptic partner RIA, did not show any detectable rescue of the AIY presynaptic defect (Fig. 4 H)."

These possibilities can be distinguished in mosaic animals in which tir-1 activity is altered in only one of the two AWC neurons. The partial penetrance of tir-1 mutations was problematic for mosaic analysis, so the gain-of-function phenotype of tir-1 overexpression was used. The single DsRed-expressing AWC cell did not express str-2 GFP in 95% of the animals, a percentage consistent with a cell-autonomous repression of str-2 GFP by the odr-3::tir-1 transgene in that neuron. The AWC neuron in the mosaics that did not express DsRed should be genotypically wild-type. Approximately 40% of the AWC cells that lacked DsRed fluorescence expressed str-2 GFP."

Remark	"Mosaic analysis was conducted in nsy-4(ky616);str2::GFP animals using unstable extrachromosomal arrays of odr-3::nsy-4 and the AWC marker odr-1::dsRed. Mosaic animals were recognized by loss of dsRed in one of the two AWC neurons, and expression of str-2::GFP was scored in the wild-type (dsRed+) and mutant (dsRed2) AWC cell. In one major class of mosaic animals, the cell expressing dsRed became AWCON, and the mutant cell became AWCOFF. In the second significant class of mosaic animals, both cells became AWCOFF. The first class suggests that nsy-4 acts primarily cell-autonomously in AWCON to promote AWCON receptor choice and is consistent with a function in signal reception. The second class can be explained by incomplete rescue from the extrachromosomal arrays."

Second, mosaic animals that lost the array in the AWBR lineage (ABpra) but retained it in both AWC neurons had a significant bias in left-right asymmetry, such that 71% of the AWCR neurons became AWCON.

To separate cell-intrinsic functions of olrn-1 from possible network functions, we generated mosaics overexpressing OLRN-1 in one AWC in nsy-5 mutants. In these experiments,olrn-1(OE) behaved exactly as it did in the wild-type background, specifically converting the olrn-1-expressing neuron to AWCON. These results suggest that olrn-1 functions independently of, and most likely downstream of nsy-5 in AWCON."

The difference suggests that unc-36 and unc-2 influence the coordinated AWCON/ AWCOFF decision. The rescue of the unc-2 mutant cell in these mosaics is particularly informative. unc-2 has an incompletely penetrant phenotype; in unc-2 controls, 33% of animals have one AWCOFF neuron, and 4% have two AWCOFF neurons, so in total approximately 20% of all unc-2 mutant AWCs became AWCOFF. In unc-2 mosaics with one rescued AWC, fewer than 5% of the unc-2(-) AWCs became AWCOFF, indicating that the unc-2(-) AWC neuron was affected by the rescued AWC on the contralateral side."

To determine whether the 2AWCON phenotype is due to disruption of microtubules, we examined the effect of nocodazole on ben-1 mutants. ben-1(e1880) mutants showed wild-type expression of str-2, and treatment of ben-1(e1880) mutant embryos with nocodazole did not cause a 2AWCON phenotype (Table 1, rows d and e). However, expression of wild-type ben-1 gene primarily in AWC using an odr-3 promoter (Roayaie et al., 1998) restored the susceptibility of ben-1(e1880) mutants to nocodazole in the generation of 2AWCON phenotype."

Remark	"To assess whether kin-1 might function in the germ line to inhibit meiotic maturation, we asked whether oocytes continue to undergo meiotic maturation and ovulation upon the depletion of sperm through self-fertilization in germline mosaics. We observed that kin-1 (ok338) germline mosaics produced a total of 10 +/- 14 unfertilized oocytes as compared to 14 +/- 21 unfertilized oocytes for nonmosaic siblings.

Remark	"To test more definitively whether acy-4(ok1806) sterility requires twk-1(+) function in the somatic gonad, we conducted genetic mosaic analysis of acy-4(lf) suppression. We sought fertile genetic mosaics among twk-1(tn1397); acy-4(ok1806); tnEx180[twk-1(+) sur-5::gfp] animals, produced by acy-4(ok1806)/+ heterozygous parents using nT1[qIs51] as a dominantly marked balancer chromosome for acy-4(ok1806). Two genetic mosaics with losses in the EMS founder cell, which is a precursor to the somatic gonad, were fertile in both gonad arms. These genetic mosaics produced GFP-containing progeny, indicating that their germ lines were twk-1(+). A third genetic mosaic animal resulted from complex losses within the Z1 lineage . This animal was fertile in the anterior gonad arm, but was sterile in the posterior gonad arm. All gonadal sheath cells in the anterior gonad arm of this mosaic were twk-1(tn1397) mutant, but the germline and several anterior spermathecal cells were twk-1(+). A fourth genetic mosaic, resulting from a loss in the Z4 somatic gonadal precursor cell (and some cells within the C lineage), was fertile in the posterior gonad arm, but not the anterior gonad arm. The germ line of this animal was also twk-1(+). We conclude that twk-1 functions downstream of acy-4 in the somatic gonad to regulate meiotic maturation."

The unc-119(ed3) genetic background was utilized as a marker for the AB lineage so as to identify rare non-Unc mosaics showing the sacy-1(tm5503) gamete degeneration phenotype. We found four genetic mosaics with P1 losses, a single mosaic with a P3 loss (this animal had an independent loss within the C lineage), and two mosaics with P4 losses. This result indicates that sacy-1(+) function is required in the germ line to prevent gamete degeneration."

Remark	"It has recently been shown that some proteins required for RNAi, e.g., the RNA-binding protein RDE-4, can rescue the mutant phenotype when expressed in a third tissue, i.e., neither the sending or receiving cells.

In combination, these ablations eliminate all non-gut lineages.

Remark	"Mosaic analysis was used to determine if mig-15 acts cell-autonomously. Of 61 mosaics that retained mig-15(+) in AQR, 60 showed normal AQR migration. 12 mosaics with losses in URXR, an AB.a derivative, but not AQR had normal AQR migration."
Remark	"Mosaic analysis was used to determine if mig-15 acts cell-autonomously. Thirty three mosaics were identi&#64257;ed that had lost mig-15(+) in AQR and displayed AQR migration defects similar to mig-15(rh80) alone. 22 mosaics with losses in AQR but not in URXR had defective migration of the Q cell descendant neurons."

Remark	"To further characterize the role of the SIA and SIB neurons in nerve ring development, we killed them by expressing the egl-1 BH3 cell death gene in SIA, SIB and SMD neurons under the ceh-24 promoter. The resulting transgene killed SIA, SIB and SMD neurons inefficiently, sparing a subset of neurons in most animals. Despite this inefficiency, 20% of animals with the transgene had a nerve ring placement defect resembling that of cwn-2 mutants.

Remark	"To test for a cell autonomous role of UNC-34 in CAN cell migration, we expressed an unc-34 cDNA tagged with GFP from a ceh-23 promoter, which drove expression in the CAN and in a small subset of sensory neurons. In the null mutant unc-34(e951), only 24% of the CAN cells migrate to the wild-type location. Expression of UNC-34::GFP within the CAN increases the number of cells that reach the wild-type location to 75%. Thus, UNC-34 expression within the CAN is capable of rescuing a significant portion of the unc-34(e951) CAN cell migration defects.

Remark	"Besides the vulval cells, the DAF-18::GFP reporter was also expressed at the L3 to L4 larval stages in several cells of the uterus, which is part of the somatic gonad. We thus tested if the daf-18-mediated repression of vulval induction requires the gonad by ablating the Z1 to Z4 somatic gonad and germline precursor cells at the L1 stage. In gonad-ablated daf-18(lf) let-60(gf) double mutants, vulval induction was higher than in gonad-ablated let-60(gf) single mutants, indicating that DAF-18 represses vulval induction independently of a signal from the gonad.

Remark	"We next performed cell type-specific rescue experiments to examine the cell-autonomous function of mig-13 in cell migration. We used four distinct promoters to express the mig-13a isoform, the longest isoform of mig-13, in different Q-cell progenies: the egl-13 promoter (Pegl-13) specifically expresses in the Q.a lineage, Pgcy-32 expresses in Q.ap, Pegl-46 expresses in Q.a/Q.ap and Q.pa/Q.paa, and Pmec-7 expresses in Q.paa. By quantifying the final positions of Q-cell progenies, we showed that AQR migration defects in mig-13 mutants can be completely or partially rescued by the expression of mig-13 under the control of QR.a/ap-specific promoters, but not QR.p/paa promoter."

Remark	"Because the M cell descendants also contribute to the posterior body wall muscle and coelomocytes, we sought a cleaner way to eliminate the SMs before the polarity cue. The SoxC ortholog sem-2(n1343) alters the M cell lineage and prevents the formation of the SMs by driving the cells initially destined to become SMs to become posterior body wall muscle. Constructing sem-2(n1343); lin-18(e620) double mutants results in a 68% P-Rvl phenotype, confirming that the SMs influence the polarity choice of P7.p."

Remark	"One interesting finding from this experiment is that the mosaic animals with Ncl ALMs have a higher frequency of reversed ALMs than cam-1; ncl-1 mutants that do not carry the transgenic array, which we interpret as an enhancement of the ALM defect. One explanation for this effect is that CAM-1 has antagonistic activities in ALM polarity: an autonomous function as a Wnt receptor that promotes normal polarity, and a nonautonomous function that antagonizes Wnt function. To test this hypothesis further, we expressed CAM-1 from the myo-3 promoter in muscle cells. This expression resulted in a strong ALM polarity defect in a cam-1 mutant background, consistent with our hypothesis that CAM-1 has antagonistic functions."

Animals lacking ASEL distributed almost equally to both higher and lower pH regions, whereas animals lacking ASER moved toward higher pH just as intact wild-type animals do."

Remark	"To analyze alkaline pH sensitivity of ASE neurons in living animals, we carried out in vivo Ca2+ imaging by specifically expressing GCaMP3, a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator in ASE. ASEL was activated by elevation of pH and was slightly inactivated by lowering of pH. When the pH was elevated from 6.8 to 10.0, ASEL of both unc-13 and snb-1 mutants was activated to levels similar to those observed in wild-type animals. These results demonstrate that ASEL functions as the primary, direct sensor of environmental alkalinity in C. elegans."

Remark	"We killed the ancestor of one SGP by laser-irradiation and observed the behavior of the remaining SGP using transgenes to mark the SGP and PGC surfaces. We found that the remaining SGP always migrated to the normal location, and eventually wrapped entirely around that PGC.  In laser-irradiated embryos, we never observed the single SGP significantly over- or under-migrate, or wrap around the contralateral PGC. We conclude that even though the two SGPs undergo mirror-symmetric and synchronous morphogenetic movements, Z1 and Z4 are not dependent on each other for their posterior migration, extension of projections, or wrapping behaviors."

Remark	"In mes-1 (RNAi) embryos (PGCs are transformed into muscle-like cells), the SGPs were born at the same location as wild-type embryos. The SGPs still migrated posteriorly along the lateral edges of the endoderm in mes-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 4A and B), and they remained lateral to the endoderm but ceased migrating at a slightly more anterior position. We conclude that PGCs are dispensable for SGP posterior migration but are required for the precise positioning of SGPs at the end of their migration."

We observed that the SGPs were born in approximately the normal location in end-1 end-3 embryos.

Remark	"In end-1 end-3 mutant embryos, the endodermal cell lineage is transformed to adopt epidermal- and muscle-like cell fates. In the end-1 end-3 embryos in which the PGCs failed to ingress, the SGPs extended short dynamic projections in various directions but did not migrate to the external PGCs nor wrap around any other cell. In the end-1 end-3 embryos in which one or both PGCs had ingressed, the SGPs always extended projections around the PGCs they contacted, but these projections were often shorter and thicker than in wild type. ... We conclude that endoderm is not required for SGPs to migrate posteriorly, extend projections, or wrap around the PGCs. However, endoderm is required for the normal morphology of the SGP projections, for SGPs to reach their regular final position just posterior to the PGCs, and to prevent SGPs from shifting medially and contacting the contralateral SGP and/or PGC."

Remark	"Five obviously mosaic animals are described in categories 1 and 2 of Table 2. The category 1 mosaics are semi-Dpy and Unc. These animals were found to have cell death survivors only among cells generated from the ABp lineage. The category 2 mosaic, with an apparent ABa loss, was semiDpy and non-Unc (although this animal moved more slowly than does a wild-type animal). These results again indicate that ced-3 is cell autonomous and reveal that unc-26, like unc-30, acts in the ABp lineage."

Remark	"Published_as kin-1"
Remark	"We conducted genetic mosaic analysis using the kin-1(ok338) deletion allele. We sought array losses in the MS lineage, which gives rise to the somatic cells of the gonad. kin-1(+) somatic gonad-loss mosaics exhibit sterility because oocytes fail to undergo meiotic maturation, ovulation, and fertilization, Complex losses found within the sheath-spermathecal lineages suggest that kin-1 is needed in the gonadal sheath cells, not in the spermatheca, for meiotic maturation."
